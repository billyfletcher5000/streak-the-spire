[h1]Streak The Spire[/h1]
Streak The Spire is a mod that adds automatic (and accurate!) streak calculation based upon your run history, with effects when you increase or lose your streaks, on a per character and rotating basis. It even has animated character icons using the existing animations from the game!

It is highly configurable, allowing you to drag and resize the display and put it anywhere you want, with a number of different background options (including no background at all), as well as customise the criteria used to determine if a given run counts to your streaks.

It also provides helpful tooltips with more information on your historical play, including your best win streak of all time, the dates your streaks occurred and your win rate, all calculated depending on the criteria you select. It even integrates with Slay The Relics (+ Reborn)!

[h2]Configuring Streak the Spire[/h2]
Configuration of the mod happens in one of two ways:

[h3]Panel Configuration[/h3]
To move, resize or change the background of the panel simply hold down [b]ALT[/b]
on your keyboard and your mouse will be able to resize and move the panel.

You will also see a small button next to the panel, which allows you to cycle
though all the available border styles.
